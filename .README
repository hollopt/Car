This project implements Wi-Fi communication and interfaces two microcontrollers to build a remote-controlled car with a horn. 

The ESP32-C3-devkitc-02 generates a WiFi port. A laptop connects to it and runs the python script to transmit commands.

The STM32 Nucleo L432KC receives the command through I2C (ESP = controller, STM = Peripheral). This generates an interrupt, which 
adjusts motor speed (PWM duty), motor direction (H-Bridge), or sounds the horn (DAC).
